The Globetrotter Demo
=====================

This demo illustrates a simple application that can be tested through Artemis and 
Artemis' support for AIL descriptions.

The tested application, Globetrotter, is a travel application system used internally
by the Department of Computer Science at Aarhus University. In the ``fixtures`` folder
you will find an AIL description[1] detailing Globetrotter's client-server 
communication and any static HTML and JavaScript files used by Globetrotter.

Two tools are required to test this Globetrotter, an AIL proxy and Artemis itself.
Follow these three steps:

Step 1: Compile prerequisites
 - Compile the AIL proxy (See the README file in the ``proxies`` folder)
 - Compile Artemis (see the INSTALL file in root of the repository)

Step 2: Run the AIL proxy
 - Navigate (in a terminal) to the ``proxies`` folder
 - Run the command
 
   > node ailproxy.js ../demo/globetrotter/fixtures/ail-descriptions/globetrotter.ail --server-only-mode ../demo/globetrotter/fixtures/static-files

   Verify that the proxy is working by visiting the URL 
   ``http://localhost:8080/globetrotter/`` in your favorite browser. You should see 
   the Globetrotter application.

Step 3: Run Artemis
 - In another terminal, run the following command

   > artemis -t localhost:8080 -i 10 http://local.tld/globetrotter/

   Notice, use local.tld and not localhost (see issue [2])
