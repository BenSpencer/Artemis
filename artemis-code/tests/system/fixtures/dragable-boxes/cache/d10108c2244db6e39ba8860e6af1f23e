<p>Talk about longevity. Thirty years ago to this month, PCWorld published its very first print issue, a 310-page magazine loaded with essential news, reviews, and features about IBM PCs and compatible "clones."
</p>
<p>The content inside the March 1983 issue of <em>PC World</em> was exceedingly quaint?even borderline comical, as the <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2029725/11-adorable-images-from-the-dawn-of-the-pc-era.html">images in our accompanying slideshow</a> prove. But once you take stock of PCWorld's entire 30-year history, you begin to develop a profound appreciation for just how dramatically the PC platform has evolved?and how it has influenced the greater world of consumer electronics, from music players to smartphones to any device that's connected to the Internet and geared toward social sharing.

1998 qualifies as ancient history, but if you want to see the <em>really</em> early days of PCWorld, you need to revisit our first year of magazine publishing, which <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2027069/30-years-of-pcworld-30-pivotal-moments-in-pc-history.html">commenced in March 1983</a>?exactly 30 years ago.

<p>
Google is open-sourcing a new general purpose data compression library called Zopfli that can be used to speed up Web downloads.
</p>
<p>
The Zopfli Compression Algorithm, which got its name from a Swiss bread recipe, is an implementation of the Deflate compression algorithm that creates a smaller output size compared to previous techniques, <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.nl/2013/02/compress-data-more-densely-with-zopfli.html">wrote</a> Lode Vandevenne, a software engineer with Google's Compression Team, on the Google Open Source Blog last week.

<p>
"The smaller compressed size allows for better space utilization, faster data transmission, and lower Web page load latencies. Furthermore, the smaller compressed size has additional benefits in mobile use, such as lower data transfer fees and reduced battery use," Vandevenne wrote.
</p>
<p>
The more exhaustive compression techniques used achieve higher data density but also make the compression a lot slower. This does not affect the decompression speed, though, Vandenne wrote.

Most of the challenges stem from the rapid multiplication of demand, both in terms of user devices and data, according to IDC analyst Rohit Mehra, who moderated the MIT Forum discussion on "Can the networks deliver?" at the Tang Center for Management Education.

Instagram fans who want more instant gratification from the photo sharing service and social network are getting some help from Polaroid.
</p>
<p>
In the <a href="http://www.social-matic.com/site/2013/02/20/12/">first quarter of 2014</a>, you?ll be able to buy a Polaroid-branded instant digital camera that will let you shoot photos, apply Instagram filters, share them on Facebook and Instagram, and print your snapshot on Polaroid-style paper.
</p>
<p>
The idea makes sense considering that both Polaroid and Instagram appeal to people because of their hipster vibes.
</p>
<p>
It can?t be denied?tons of people get a kick out of Instagram. In fact, the service says <a href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/44078783561/100-million">more than 100 million people use it</a> every month. Unless you?re a photography purist, Instagram is fun to use if you?re creatively-inclined, and transforms ordinary photos into retro-style artistic creations that you can share with friends and followers in just a few clicks on your mobile device.

<p>Yahoo is beefing up technology offerings and streamlining its media products in another sign it wants to improve its game against industry titans like Google, Apple and Facebook.
</p>
<p>It is putting the axe to more than a half dozen of its less popular products as CEO Marissa Mayer, a former Google engineer who worked her way up to a vice president post, remakes the company known as a hip Web portal into a more competitive player across the spectrum.
</p>
<p>The company said Friday most of the products it is dumping will either shut down April 1 or not be supported after that date.
</p>
<p>Yahoo said in a <a href="http://ycorpblog.com/2013/03/01/3553567/">blog post</a> that affected products include Yahoo Avatars, Yahoo app for BlackBerry, Yahoo Clues (beta), Yahoo App Search, Yahoo Sports IQ, Yahoo Message Boards website, and Yahoo Updates API.
