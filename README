Usage:

   artemis [-i <n>][-c <URL>][-t <URL>][-r][-u][-p <path>] <url>

   Test the JavaScript application found at <url>.

   -i <n>  : Iterations - Artemis will generate and execute <n>
      	     sequences of events. Default is 4.

   -c <URl>: Cookies - // TODO

   -t <URL>: Proxy - // TODO

   -r      : set_recreate_page(true) // TODO

   -p	   : dump_page_states(<path>) // TODO 

   -s       : Enable DOM state checking  

   --strategy-form-input-generation <strategy>: 
   			  Select form input generation strategy.

   			  javascript-constants - select form inputs based in observed JavaScript constants
   			  random - (default) random inputs 

   --coverage-report <report-type>:
               Select code coverage report formatting.

               html - HTML report dumped in the folder you run Artemis from
               stdout - text report is printed to std out
               none - (default) code coverage report is omitted

   --strategy-priority <strategy>:
               Select priority strategy.

               constant - (default) assign the same priority to new configurations
               random - assign a random priority to new configurations
               coverage - assign higher priority to configurations with low coverage
               readwrite - use read/write-sets for JavaScript properties to assign priorities
