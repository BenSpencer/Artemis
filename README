Artemis is a tool that performs automated, feedback-directed testing
of JavaScript applications.

The tool is being developed by the Programming Languages group at
Aarhus University and the Program Analysis and Transformation group at
IBM Research.

For more information, see http://brics.dk/artemis/

Contained in this repository is, besides the source for the tool, an
instrumented version of the WebKit code-base.

Usage:

	artemis [-i <n>][-c <URL>][-t <URL>][-r][-u][-p <path>] <url>

   Test the JavaScript application found at <url>.

   -i <n>  : Iterations - Artemis will generate and execute <n>
      	     sequences of events. Default is 4.

   -c <URl>: Cookies - // TODO

   -t <URL>: Proxy - // TODO

   -r      : set_recreate_page(true) // TODO

   -p	   : dump_page_states(<path>) // TODO   

   --strategy-form-input-generation <strategy>: 
   			  Select form input generation strategy.

   			  javascript-constants - select form inputs based in observed JavaScript constants
   			  random - (default) random inputs 

   --coverage-report <report-type>:
               Select code coverage report formatting.

               html - HTML report dumped in the folder you run Artemis from
               stdout - text report is printed to std out
               none - (default) code coverage report is omitted

   --strategy-priority <strategy>:
               Select priority strategy.

               constant - (default) assign the same priority to new configurations
               random - assign a random priority to new configurations
               coverage - assign higher priority to configurations with low coverage
