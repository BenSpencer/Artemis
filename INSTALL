The following instructions assumes you are using a (64 bit) Linux-based system. 
Artemis has been successfully installed on Ubuntu 14.04 and Fedora 18.

 0. Fetch all software dependencies using
    
      make fetch-[apt|yum] (requires root privileges)
    
    Artemis requires Qt version 4.8.x.
    Under Ubuntu the correct packages should be included by ``make fetch-apt``.
    
    If a suitable version of Qt is not provided by your distribution, then you
    can use the following command to download and compile a version compatible
    with Artemis.

      make fetch-qt

    This will place a version of Qt 4.8 in the `qt/` folder.

    You can check your Qt version using the command ``qmake --version``
    (if qmake is missing then Qt is not installed).
    Note, you need to set the QTDIR and PATH variables described in step 1.
    
    If Qt 5.x is the default version, it can be changed with the `qtchooser`
    tool or by installing the Ubuntu package `qt4-default`.
    
 1. Configure your environment variables by running
    
      export QTDIR=<qt_path>
      export PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
      export ARTEMISDIR=<artemis_git_reposity_path>

    where `<qt_path>` is the QT 4.8 installation directory, either
    the one provided by your distribution or the `qt/` folder 
    mentioned in step 0, and where `<artemis_git_repository_path>` 
    is the directory with this INSTALL file in it.

    `<qt_path>` is /usr/share/qt4 on Ubuntu systems and
    /usr/lib64/qt4/bin on Fedora.

 2. Build Artemis
    
      make all

3. Configure your path to include Artemis executable

      export PATH=$ARTEMISDIR/artemis-code/dist:$PATH

4. Enable completion in bash by running
    
      cp artemis-code/scripts/artemis-bash-complete /etc/bash_completion.d/artemis 
    
    as root.
