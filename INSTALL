 0. Fetch all software dependencies using
    
      make fetch-[apt|yum]
	
    If you have no Qt or a version older than 4.8 then run: 

      make fetch-qt
    
 1. Set up your environment variables by running
    
      export QTDIR=<qtpath>
      export PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH

    where `<qtpath>` is the QT 4.8 installation directory, either
    the one provided by your distribution or the one installed in
    step 0.

    On Ubuntu this is /usr/share/qt4
     
 2. Build and install Artemis
   
   	  make install

 3. Add the instrumented WebKit library to your library path

      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path>/WebKit/WebKitBuild/Release/lib  

    where `<path>` is the root directory of the Artemis repository.

    You will need to add this environment variable every time you
    subsequently wish to use Artemis.
